1) Type these install commands in command prompt:

pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
pip install django-cors-headers
pip install pymysql
pip install django-bootstrap-v5

2) Create a branch on github to download server files (download the github files to your local computer)
  - you can edit them in VS code

3) To access the LIVE database server, get on MySQL workbench
    - Cick the '+' icon next to MySQL Connections
    - name the connection name "pos-mysql-server"
    - Connection method = Stanard(TCP/IP)
    - hostname=pos-mysql-server.mysql.database.azure.com
    - username=username 
    - password=Password#1
    - go to the SSL tab and make the "Use SSL" mode "Require"
    - download "DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem" from this github repo
    - set the file location of the file you just downloaded to be the "SSL CA File" path.
    - test connection (this should work, if not, troubleshoot)
    - You should be able access the server now.
    
4) In order to check what you have updated in the Database server:
  - go to the file location ...\Django_API>
  - open cmd
  - "python manage.py makemigrations POS"
  - this will create a folder with a file called "0001_initial.py" with the changed contents within it
  - in order to push your changed back onto the server/database do the following command:
    - ..../Django_API>python manage.py migrate POS
  
5) To run the application (website) locally, use the following command:
  - "python manage.py runserver"
  - copy paste the part that looks something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ into your browswer. The numbers will be different.
